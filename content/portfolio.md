## Our Work

We measure our success by the impact we create for our clients. Here are some examples of how we've helped organizations solve complex infrastructure challenges.

---

### Enterprise Network Modernization — Financial Services

**Challenge:** A mid-size financial services firm was running a legacy flat network with aging Cisco Catalyst switches, creating performance bottlenecks and security risks across 12 branch offices.

**Solution:** We designed and deployed a modern campus network with spine-leaf architecture at the data center, SD-WAN connectivity across all branches, and comprehensive network segmentation to meet regulatory requirements.

**Results:**
- 60% improvement in application performance
- Full PCI-DSS network compliance achieved
- Centralized management across all locations via SD-WAN orchestrator

### Cloud Migration — Healthcare Provider

**Challenge:** A regional healthcare provider needed to migrate critical workloads from on-premise data centers to the cloud while maintaining HIPAA compliance and minimizing downtime.

**Solution:** We performed a cloud readiness assessment, designed a hybrid architecture on Microsoft Azure, and executed a phased migration with zero patient-facing downtime. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) was implemented for consistent, repeatable deployments.

**Results:**
- 40% reduction in infrastructure costs
- HIPAA-compliant cloud architecture certified by third-party auditor
- Disaster recovery RTO reduced from 24 hours to under 1 hour

### Security Transformation — Manufacturing Company

**Challenge:** A manufacturing company experienced a ransomware incident that exposed gaps in their security posture. They needed a comprehensive security overhaul — fast.

**Solution:** We conducted an incident response engagement, then designed and implemented a Zero Trust architecture including next-gen firewalls, endpoint detection and response (EDR), SIEM with 24/7 monitoring, and employee security awareness training.

**Results:**
- Zero security incidents in the 18 months following deployment
- SOC 2 Type II certification achieved
- Full network visibility with automated threat detection and response

### SD-WAN Deployment — Retail Chain

**Challenge:** A national retail chain with 80+ locations was struggling with expensive MPLS circuits, inconsistent application performance, and no centralized visibility into network health.

**Solution:** We designed and rolled out an SD-WAN solution with redundant internet circuits at each location, application-aware routing, and a centralized management platform. The project was completed in phases with zero store downtime.

**Results:**
- 45% reduction in WAN costs by replacing MPLS with broadband + SD-WAN
- Real-time visibility into all 80+ sites from a single dashboard
- Improved performance for cloud-based POS and inventory systems
